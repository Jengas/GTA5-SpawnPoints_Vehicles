# GTA5-SpawnPoints_Vehicles
* Parking spots for vehicles in GTA5.
* Created for other developers to use in their scripts for platforms like RageMP or FiveM to customize spawning.
* Data was collected via scripts, driving around and capturing naturally spawning vehicles over 16+ hours.

## Notes
    * There are over 1,500 entries.
        * It's very well spread across the whole map.
        * Includes parking lots, side street parking, etc.
        * It's NOT a complete list.
        * It's NOT a perfect list.
    * No emergency, no military, and no police vehicle spawns.
    * There are a few boat spawns.
    * There are heli, and possibly plane spawns.
    * There may be entries were vehicles are parked at a gas station, at a stop light, or in the middle of the street, but these cases are rare and cleaning them up shouldn't be too painful.
